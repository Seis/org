    I supervise research and development of the Brazilian Digital Signature
    Standard, and act as a consultant to a breadth of projects related to
    information security. I specialize in quantum-safe cryptography and
    public-key infrastructures.

      I lead the team whose job is to improve, maintain and add features to the
      Brazilian Digital Signature Standard official implementation, all derived
      applications, and normative documents. As a result, we enable any
      Brazilian citizen to generate and verify digitally signed files according
      to the latest standards.

\begin{contenttable}{Personal values and interests}
  I strive to solve problems and deliver elegant solutions with great
    efficiency, attention to detail, and a minimal number of tools---most
    likely awk, Bash, tmux and Vim. \\

  I'm also committed to bring out the best of the people working alongside me,
    through frequent knowledge transfers and a constant feedback loop. \\

  I'm enthusiastic about astronomy, immersive sim games, IBM keyboards
    specifically older than myself and most songs with a saxophone line. 8)
