        I am a MSc student at the
        <a href="https://labsec.ufsc.br">Computer Security Lab</a> of the
        <a href="https://ufsc.br">Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina</a>,
        researching usability of security protocols.

      <h3>Professional experience</h3>
      <p>
        Since you already have my CV, I will just say some things about myself that are not in there.
        Over the years since entering computer science, I've started a home-lab where I implemented open-source 
        solutions for digital library, media streaming, virtualization, photo management, file synchronization,
        and network-wide ad-blocking. All data is stored on robust file systems and the network 
        is managed by OpenWrt. I've configured the entire setup for high availability and extended the standard 
        1-2-3 backup strategy to include both a physically separated, georedundant copy and a separate, in the cloud backup. 
        As a minimum expected of someone that works daily with security, all of my data is encrypted, all the network traffic
        is routed via private tunnels, and all of the synchronization is automated.
        I also have a passion for vintage cars, particularly those that are around my age or older, I'm capable of tearing apart, fixing and putting back together quite
        complex mechanical and electrical systems on those rust buckets.
        Finally, I have a deep relationship with music, both hearing and playing either strings or keys, which has been a lifelong passion of mine.
        I find that music is a great way to express myself and to connect with others, and it has been a constant source of joy in my life.
