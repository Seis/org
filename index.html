      <p>
        I am a PhD student at the
        <a href="https://labsec.ufsc.br">Computer Security Lab</a> of the
        <a href="https://ufsc.br">Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina</a>,
        researching novel combinatorial (un)ranking algorithms to generate
        random objects in quantum-safe cryptosystems.
      </p>

      On a personal note, I’m enthusiastic about astronomy, immersive sim
      games, IBM keyboards specifically older than myself and most songs with
      a saxophone line. 8)

      <p>
        I am interested in quantum-safe cryptosystems and their applications,
        particularly hash-based signatures.

      <h3>Professional experience</h3>
      <p>
        I also work as an consultant, helping private and public institutions
        to solve complex problems related to information security. Before
        starting my doctoral studies, I was the technical lead of research
        & development for the Brazilian Digital Signature Standard.

          See details about my previous experience here.
        </summary>
        <p>
          As part of the Computer Security Lab, I mainly delved into the
          official Brazilian Digital Signature Standard implementation of the
          Brazilian Public-Key Infrastructure (ICP-Brasil), and several PKI and
          digital signatures technical specifications.
