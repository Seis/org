        <a href="https://ufsc.br">Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina</a>,
        researching usability of security protocols.

      <h3>Personal info</h3>
      <p>
        To give you a better sense of what moves me, here's what I do in my free time:<br><br>
        Over the years since entering computer science, I've started a homelab where I implemented open-source 
        solutions for digital library, media streaming, virtualization, photo management, file synchronization, 
        and network-wide ad-blocking. <br>
        All data is stored on robust file systems, and the network is managed by OpenWrt. I also extended the 
        standard 3-2-1 backup strategy to include a physically separated, private, georedundant copy and a 
        separate cloud backup. As a minimum expected of someone that works daily with security, all of my data is encrypted,
         all the network traffic is routed via private tunnels, and all of the synchronization is automated.<br><br>
        I have a deep relationship with music, both hearing and playing either strings or keys, 
        which has been a lifelong passion of mine. I find that music is a delightful alternative to express myself and to 
        connect with others, and it has been a constant source of joy.<br><br>
        Finally, I also have a passion for cars, particularly those that are around my age or older, 
        I'm capable of tearing apart, fixing and putting back together quite complex mechanical and electrical systems 
        on those rust buckets. In the end, whether I'm modifying an electrical harness to upgrade the audio system, 
        reworking the entire gear lever mechanism, or rebuilding an engine, working on a 90s Cars are (sometimes) a rewarding hobby 
        that provides a welcome, hands-on break from screens and digital systems.
